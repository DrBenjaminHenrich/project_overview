# Project and Side Hustle Overview
This GitHub page serves as a historical archive of my side hustle, reflecting my passion and the motivation behind these projects. It provides an overview of my work and the driving forces that inspire me.


### Flag Ship Project - Smart-Check In: Automated Customer Check-In Platform (Sommer 2024)
I developed an automated solution for a customer check-in platform that streamlines the registration process. Using a mobile phone to scan a QR code, customers can complete their check-in seamlessly in just a few steps. This solution ensures:

Quick and hassle-free registration:
- Optimized customer experience
- Integration-ready design for diverse industries
- The platform is built with a focus on user-friendliness, efficiency, and scalability, making it ideal for businesses looking to modernize their check-in processes.

- 2024 MIMIR - Making Cloud GPU Computing Affordable & Accessible To All:  I concluded a startup in the area of graphic power architecture and customer journey with a focus on interface design, aiming to offer GPU computing power via a marketplace in the B2B sector. Unfortunately, the founding team arround Lucas Schmitt, decided to cease operations due to challenges in the compensation landscape within the GPU market.

- 2024 RetireDoc: This startup offered a simple, device-independent documentation solution with a modern design. It provided a standardized platform for storing and managing documents, ensuring state-of-the-art data encryption for security. The data servers were located in Germany, guaranteeing compliance with local regulations. The service ensured reliability through redundancy, making it a trustworthy option for users. With a paper-free approach, it supported sustainable documentation practices. Additionally, the platform was cost-effective compared to other providers on the market and utilized in-house AI for enhanced efficiency. Users could migrate their current documentation—whether paper-based or digital—quickly and at no cost. The tech stack was based on Python, PyTorch, Flask, SQL, Amazon AWS, and Docker. Further development of the project was canceled due to the need to comply with medical regulatory requirements.
  
- 2022 Tomorrow's AfterMe: The goal of Tomorrow's AfterMe was to provide digital cloud storage for important documents and memories to share post-mortem with family. Due to challenges with German regulations and privacy, the project’s minimal viable product (MVP) was no longer developed. The tech stack was built on Microsoft Azure cloud services.

- 2022 - Tomorrow's Therapy: A platform that was meant to provide all services, similar to Booking.com, for booking medical appointments. This project was not sustainable due to high server costs. The tech stack included Python Flask, HTML, JavaScript, and other web technologies.

- 2020 - 2021 ePitches: At an early-stage startup, the goal was to optimize the job application process using a video-based platform. Applicants were encouraged to use a pitch format to introduce themselves. The project utilized Amazon AWS, Python, Docker, and SQL but was ultimately discontinued due to a lack of demand.

- 2020 Tech Hippo is a learning platform based on different services. The goal of this side hustle was to develop an Apple Store app. To achieve this, a client-server architecture was created to connect the app via API to the server and provide services through a user interface with an enhanced experience. Various technologies were used, including Apple Xcode, Python, and SQL. The application was sold.

## Advancing Data Science and Coding: My Contributions Through Published Works
I' am the author of several published works focusing on data, the evolving data landscape, and coding methodologies. My publications delve into topics ranging from data democratization and access, to the application of advanced coding techniques in real-world scenarios. These books, available through platforms such as Springer Link, aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. Through these contributions, I strive to advance the field of data science and foster innovation within the broader data and technology ecosystem.

## Empowering Innovation Through Knowledge Sharing and Technology Leadership
As a passionate advocate for knowledge sharing, I have served as a guest professor, lecturer, and mentor for several universities and startup incubators. My mission is to inspire the next generation of innovators by sharing insights on Data Science, Software Engineering, and leveraging technology to extract actionable knowledge from data.

As example, one of my projects focused on identifying forest fires using modern technologies, specifically through machine learning models in the area of image recognition. This work leveraged a robust dataset of satellite images, enabling the detection and prediction of forest fires with improved accuracy and speed. By applying advanced image recognition techniques, the project contributed to enhancing early warning systems and supporting efforts to mitigate environmental and economic damage caused by wildfires.

In addition to teaching and mentoring, I actively contribute to shaping the future of science and technology by serving on various advisory boards. My focus lies in fostering impactful innovation and guiding organizations on the strategic integration of emerging technologies.
